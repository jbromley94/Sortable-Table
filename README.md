This is a small technical test for a company based in Manchester. 

It shall be made private upon receipt of the company's opinions on my completed task. 

It uses HTML5, CSS and jQuery/JavaScript to produce a sortable table that receives a JSON object from an API. Which is rendered upon response. 

It was a fun task, and nice to get reacquainted with jQuery and pure HTML.
